***I am 25 years old. I have a family and a child after maternity leave I want to go to work as a developer of websites and applications***

***My professional education

***I graduated with honors from the Gomel State College of Folk Arts and Crafts with a degree in artist of decorative and applied art and teacher. Although it is the word artist that is most suitable for my vocation, since I was more able to perform on stage and participate in various events than to draw and craft***

*** At the moment I am studying at the correspondence department in "The Belarusian State University of Culture and Arts"
The educational establishment "The Belarusian State University of Culture and Arts" is the leading institution of higher education in the sphere of culture Belarus.***

***My specialization is "Computer technology in Art". I like to combine computer technology and art, so now I am studying at RS School and taking a course in JS\Frontend development. The preparatory stage is a new and interesting experience for me.***

***While studying at the university, we studied graphic programs for processing and creating images and videos. but most of all I liked to study the creation of websites. We created websites on Wordpress and Joomla. There were basic lectures on html and css, seo optimization.***

***That's when I got the idea to study programming. There are also friends in my environment who are also interested in programming. And so a friend advised RS School. I was interested in this offer and I signed up for the zero level***

***The program is good , I like it . Yes, it can be difficult and some things don't really work out yet. But I'm very interested. For example, when I'm doing a task and I can't complete the task, then I sit and try to solve it, and so a lot of time can pass and the whole night will fly by, and I don't want to sleep at all until I fix the bug.***
